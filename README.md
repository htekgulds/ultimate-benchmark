# My Ultimate Benchmark

This project aims to compare performance of different programming languages and frameworks for these languages.

The aim is to include a variaty of tasks like database read/write, file operations, API calls, etc. so that every language and framework can show where it shines.

This is a simple and non-exhaustive/non-scientific/non-professional benchamrking project that is mainly for me to learn about other languages and see their weak and strong poitns. Also for anyone else who is equally interested in the same topic.

Any and all contribution is appreciated.

## Database

I used Postgresql and pgadmin for database management.

There is a good sample database [here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/) which I also used since I didn't want to generate my own. There are tables, functions, views, everything I might need for the benchmark in this sample.
